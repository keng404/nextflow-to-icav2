# Different ICA nextflow pipeline characteristics

## option 1: nextflow pipeline is not DSL2 compatible
    - proceed as normal
    - read config files (nextflow.config -> all other configs)
    - strip out ICA hard-coded params from nextflow.config ( nextflow.config -> ica_nextflow.config)
    - ensure profile docker-enabled is true in ica_nextflow.config
    - inject params into main.nf, workflow/subworkflow files, and modules
** Users will need to smoke test their pipeline code as syntax errors may have been introduced due to the parameter injection **

## option 2: nextflow pipeline is DSL2 compatible. nextflow.config eventually points to a modules.config file
    - initially proceed as normal
    - read config files (nextflow.config -> all other configs)
    - strip out ICA hard-coded params from nextflow.config ( nextflow.config -> ica_nextflow.config)
    - inject params into modules config file
        - General settings - memory, cpu, maxForks, pod annotation, publishDir?
        - Specific modules - select pod annotation based on cpu/memory configuration, maxForks
    - Add in configuration files (ica_nextflow.config-> nextflow config ; other configs to other files) to the create pipeline commands


## option 3: nextflow pipeline is DSL2 compatible. nextflow.config does not point to a modules.config file
    - read config files (nextflow.config -> all other configs)
    - strip out ICA hard-coded params from nextflow.config ( nextflow.config -> ica_nextflow.config)
    - ensure profile docker-enabled is true in ica_nextflow.config
    - copy in template modules.config file to pipeline dir
    - Add in reference to nextflow.config file includeConfig 'conf/modules.config'
    - Add in configuration files (ica_nextflow.config-> nextflow config ; other configs to other files) to the create pipeline commands
